    "### Exercise: calculating the utilisation of the call operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 111 caller model is replicated below.  At the moment this only collects results for the mean waiting time experienced by callers. Your task is to update the code so that the average utilsation of the call operators is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new entry to the results dictionary with the key `total_call_duration`\n",
    "    * You will use `results['total_call_duration']` to store the total time operators are in use during the model run.\n",
    "2. Modify the `service` function to update `total_call_duration` after each call completes.  \n",
    "3. After the run has completed calculate the average operator utilisation.\n",
    "4. Print the results to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `service ` function could update the total_call_duration as follows (where `call_duration` is the length of time a caller has just spent with an operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "results['total_call_duration'] += call_duration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average operator utilisation is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mean_util = results['total_call_duration'] / (RUN_LENGTH * N_OPERATORS) * 100.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> note we don't quite capture all operator utilisation using this method.  When the simulation terminates there will be a number of callers in service.  This can be fixed using some additional logic, and its up to you to decide if this is an issue with results reporting.  For this exercise we will ignore it.\n",
